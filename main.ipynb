    "## **Northeastern SMILE Lab - Recognizing Faces in the Wild**\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMILE Lab at Northeastern focuses on the frontier research of applied machine learning, social media analytics, human-computer interaction, and high-level image and video understanding. Their research is driven by the explosion of diverse multimedia from the Internet, including both personal and publicly available photos and videos. They start by treating fundamental theory from learning algorithms as the soul of machine intelligence and arm it with visual perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Northeastern University has been developing an automatic kinship classifier since 2010. However, the widespread adoption of this technology has been hindered by two primary factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Limitations: Existing image databases for kinship recognition are insufficient in size and diversity to accurately represent global familial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Complexity: The complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors influencing facial features necessitates a more advanced model than traditional computer vision algorithms, which are typically designed for higher-level tasks like facial recognition or object classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data provided in this competition, I built the following model to predict the probability of two individuals being related (1) based solely on a facial image of each person. "
